# Calculatororor

This is a stupid calculator which doesn't anything.

It knows the following operations:

-   Addition: `+`
-   Subtraction: `-`
-   Multiplication: `*`
-   Division: `/`
-   Modulus: `%`
-   Power: `^`
-   Negation: `-`

Operator Precedence? What's that? Brackets? Never heard of it.
